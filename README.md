# Asynchronous Banking System with .NET Core (Portfolio Project)

## Overview

This repository showcases a portfolio project I developed to gain practical experience with asynchronous programming in .NET Core. As I transition into the .NET development field, this project was instrumental in building hands-on skills with C# and modern application development techniques.

The project implements a simplified banking system, incorporating features like:

* Account transactions
* Currency exchange
* Credit score checking (simulated)
* Demonstrations of asynchronous operations for efficient data handling and a responsive user experience (where applicable).

This project was inspired by and built upon the concepts taught in the "[Name of the Coursera Guided Project]" on Coursera.

## Motivation

Driven by my career shift towards .NET development, I undertook this project to:

* Deepen my understanding of C# and the .NET Core ecosystem.
* Acquire practical expertise in asynchronous programming, a vital skill for building robust and scalable applications.
* Create a tangible demonstration of my developing abilities for potential opportunities within the .NET landscape.
* Underscore my dedication to learning and integrating into the .NET developer community.

## Key Learnings

Through the development of this project, I gained practical insights and skills in:

* **Core C# Concepts:** Applying fundamental C# syntax and programming principles.
* **.NET Core Development:** Understanding the basics of building applications with the .NET Core framework.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Implementing and comprehending the use of `async` and `await` for non-blocking execution.
* **Task Management:** Utilizing the Task Parallel Library (implicitly through `async/await`) for managing concurrent operations.
* **Basic System Architecture:** Conceptualizing the interaction between different components within a software system.

## How to Run (Optional - If applicable)

To run this project locally:

1.  Ensure the .NET Core SDK is installed on your system.
2.  Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
3.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4.  For a console application, execute:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
5.  For a web API project, navigate to the API subdirectory and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    (Note: Specific run instructions might vary based on the project's nature.)

## Next Steps

My journey into .NET development is ongoing. My immediate plans include:

* Exploring more advanced features of C# and .NET Core.
* Developing more complex portfolio-worthy projects.
* Investigating software testing methodologies and architectural patterns.
* Contributing to open-source initiatives as my skills grow.
